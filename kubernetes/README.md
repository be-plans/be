# Kubernetes

The Kubernetes plan provides the Kubernetes binaries for controller and worker
nodes. It can be used as a base for custom plans and serves as a base package
for the `lilian/kubernetes-*` subpackages, i.e.

* kubernetes-apiserver
* kubernetes-controller-manager
* kubernetes-scheduler
* kubernetes-kubelet
* kubernetes-proxy

To setup Kubernetes with Habitat, each of the subpackages / Kubernetes
components need to be loaded and configured individually. As Kubernetes
configuration is fairly complex and very environment specific, we don't attempt
to provide instructions here. A great guide to get started it "Kubernetes
The Hard Way": https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way

A complete "Kubernetes The Hab Way" demo setup can be found on GitHub and used
as a start: https://github.com/kinvolk/kubernetes-the-hab-way It outlines the
fundamental steps to setup a Kubernetes cluster with a single controller and
three worker nodes. The README briefly explains each of the steps taken.
